# DinoCore Production Flasher

A comprehensive suite of Python-based tools for flashing and managing ESP32-S3 devices for the DinoCore project. The tools are designed for different use cases, from development to production and partner use.

## Project Overview

The core functionality revolves around `esptool` for flashing firmware, `pyserial` for device communication, and `requests` for interacting with the DinoCore API to fetch firmware builds.

## Features

- **Interactive Console**: Command-line interface for developers with full device management capabilities
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly graphical interface for internal use
- **Partner Flasher**: Simplified GUI application for external partners (standalone executable)
- **Automatic Flasher**: Production environment script for automated flashing
- **Firmware Management**: Automatic download of latest firmware from DinoCore API
- **eFuse Management**: Hardware version burning and reading capabilities
- **Serial Monitoring**: Real-time device communication and debugging
- **üöÄ Auto-Update System**: Automatic updates from GitHub with backup and rollback
- **üì¶ Version Management**: Centralized version tracking and changelog
- **üîç Update Checks**: On-demand update checks and notifications

## Installation

### Dependencies

The project requires Python and the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.ini` to set the target hardware version:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
TARGET_HW_VERSION = 1.9.0
```

## Usage

### Dino Console (for developers)

The interactive command-line interface supports:

- Listing connected devices
- Checking for and downloading latest production and testing firmware
- Flashing both production and testing firmware
- Burning hardware versions to the eFuse
- Reading eFuse values
- Serial monitor for debugging

To run the interactive console:

```bash
python dino_console.py <hardware_version>
```

For example:

```bash
python dino_console.py 1.9.0
```

To use the local development server:

```bash
python dino_console.py <hardware_version> --local
```

### GUI Flasher (for internal use)

A graphical user interface that provides:

- Automatic detection and flashing of new devices
- Switching between "production" and "testing" modes
- Display of logs and progress

To run the GUI flasher:

```bash
python gui_flasher.py
```

### Partner Flasher (for external partners)

A simplified GUI application designed to be a standalone executable. It includes the necessary firmware and only supports a "testing" mode, which burns the eFuse and flashes the testing firmware.

To build the executable:

```bash
pyinstaller DinoPartnerFlasher.spec
```

The executable will be created in the `dist` directory.

### Auto Flasher (for production)

A script for automated flashing in a production environment that continuously scans for new devices and flashes them with the production firmware.

To run the auto flasher:

```bash
python auto_flasher.py
```

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32-S3 devices
- USB-to-Serial adapter (for flashing)
- Windows/Linux/Mac OS with Python 3.7+

## Dependencies

- `esptool>=4.0.0` - ESP32 flashing tool
- `pyserial>=3.5` - Serial communication
- `requests>=2.25.0` - HTTP requests for API communication
- `tkinter` - GUI framework (included with Python)

## API Integration

The tools communicate with the DinoCore API at:
`https://dinocore-telemetry-production.up.railway.app/`

- Fetches available firmware builds
- Downloads firmware files automatically
- Supports both production and testing firmware versions

## Development Conventions

### Firmware Management
The tools fetch firmware from the DinoCore API. The `dino_console.py` and `gui_flasher.py` download firmware on demand, while the `partner_flasher.py` is designed to have the firmware bundled with it.

### eFuse Burning
The `dino_console.py` and `gui_flasher.py` have explicit commands for burning the hardware version to the eFuse. This is a one-time, irreversible operation. The `partner_flasher.py` automatically attempts to burn the eFuse as part of its "testing" mode.

### Modes
The tools have different modes ("production" and "testing") that determine which firmware is used and whether eFuses are burned.

### Error Handling
The tools include error handling for common issues like missing devices, failed flashing operations, and network errors.

### GUI
The GUI tools are built with `tkinter`.

## Safety Notes

- **eFuse Burning**: Testing mode burns hardware version to eFuse. This is irreversible!
- **Production Mode**: Only flashes devices that have been properly tested and have valid eFuse versions
- **Backup**: Always backup important data before flashing
- **Power**: Ensure stable power supply during flashing operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Could not execute esptool"**
   - Ensure esptool is installed: `pip install esptool`

2. **"No compatible firmware found"**
   - Check network connection
   - Verify hardware version in config.ini
   - Check DinoCore API status

3. **"Device not found"**
   - Check USB connection
   - Try different USB port
   - Verify device drivers

4. **"Flash failed"**
   - Check device power
   - Try resetting device
   - Verify firmware files integrity

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Firmware download logic in `download_helper.py`
2. GUI components in `gui_flasher.py`
3. Serial communication in respective modules

### Building Executables

Use PyInstaller with the provided spec files:

```bash
pyinstaller DinoPartnerFlasher.spec
```
